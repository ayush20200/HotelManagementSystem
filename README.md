# HOTEL-MANGEMENT-PROGRAM(PYTHON & GUI) 
I have tried to computerize the HOTEL-MANGEMENT system through this project.
This project gives information regarding the check-in, check-out and booking facilities of the customer.
The project is written in Python 3 that uses OOPS concept i.e based on object and classes.

FOR THE GUI I HAVE USED TKINTER AND PAGE

THE NORMAL CODE IS NAMED AS MAIN.PY

TO RUN THE GUI JUST EXECUTE MAINLY.PY
